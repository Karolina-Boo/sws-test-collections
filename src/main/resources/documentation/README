This project is a bundling of existing Test Collections.
In order to have a comfortable setup process, though, we have had to modify it so that they all reside in
the same deployment environment.

Testing software, like the one used for the S3 contest may not work out of the box on this setup.
Changes to the software should be minimal and limited to the paths essentially.

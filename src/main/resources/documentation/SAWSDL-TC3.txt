2. RELEASE NOTES
------------------------------

   This is the third release of the SAWSDL service retrieval test collection named SAWSDL-TC. The collection is
   intended to support the evaluation of the performance of SAWSDL service matchmaking algorithms. 

   SAWSDL-TC has been semi-automatically derived from OWLS-TC 4 (http://projects.semwebcentral.org/projects/owls-tc/),
   which has been developed by Mahboob Alam Khalid, Martin Vasileski, Patrick Kapahnke, Benedikt Fries, and Matthias
   Klusch at the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI).
 
   SAWSDL-TC 3 provides 1080 semantic Web services written in SAWSDL (for WSDL 1.1) from 9 domains (education,
   medical care, food, travel, communication, economy, weapon, geography, simulation). 

   The restrictions of SAWSDL service descriptions of this version of SAWSDL-TC are as follows:
   (a) One single interface per description file.
   (b) One single operation per interface.
   (c) model references point to concepts described in OWL2-DL exclusively.
   (d) only automatically derived lifting schema mappings in XSLT are provided.

   The concepts used in the service input/output parts refer to  ontologies (.owl files) that are stored in the
   /ontology directory.

3. INSTALLATION
------------------------------

1  Install a local web server like the "Apache HTTP Webserver": We recommend to install XAMPP. It is an easy to
   install Apache HTTP web server distribution also containing MySQL, PHP and Perl. Despite the fact that it
   contains more applications than needed for SAWSDL-TC it allows a first time user to avoid the difficult
   configuration of the Apache HTTP web server. XAMPP is available at: http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html

2  Copy the folders "services", "ontology" and "queries" of the SAWSDL-TC release to the public http root folder
   (e.g. xampp/htdocs).

4. USED ONTOLOGIES
-----------------------------------

1   Most of the ontologies we used for the test collection SAWSDL-TC 1 were taken from Teknowledge, including the
   "Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO)" upon which several other ontologies rely.
